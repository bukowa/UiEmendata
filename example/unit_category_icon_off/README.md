### Unit Category Icon Off
    Removes unit category icons in campaign and in battle (and maybe some other places).
    Edits two files by switching visibility of the `unit_category_icon` element to `off` 
    and `Alpha` to `0` for 3 images of the general unit card (commander_light/commander_medium/commander_heavy)

    - /common ui/land_unit_card
    - /common ui/3c/land_unit_card

### Compatibility
    Compatible with anything that does not edit the same files.
    If it does, put on top, should be just fine.
